The purpose of the tunneller is to configure host access. This means all users and all processes on the host will share
the same level of access. This is accomplished by configuring the OS to have an OpenZiti DNS nameserver and IP routes
for authorized services.

## Install Linux Package

Reasons to use the package:

1. Install the tunneller as a systemd service.
1. Create permissions and policies for the tunneller to run as a non-root user.
1. Automatically enroll the identity and clean up the enrollment token in identity directory.
1. Automatically upgrade the tunneller when a new package is available.

Linux DEB packages are currently available for the x86_64 and arm64 platforms and RPM packages are available for x86_64.
ARM/v7 (32bit) binaries are available from GitHub. See [manual installation](#manual-installation).

- [Debian](./10-debian-package.mdx)
- [RedHat](./20-redhat-package.mdx)
- [Manual](./30-manual-installation.mdx)

## Adding Identities

The tunneller can run with zero or more identities loaded, and needs at least one to make OpenZiti services available on
the host. Adding an identity means providing a JWT enrollment token which is used by the tunneller to obtain a client
certificate from the OpenZiti controller. [Learn more about OpenZiti Identities](/learn/core-concepts/identities/overview.mdx).

### Add a Single Identity

Root and members of group `ziti` may add an identity without restarting. 

```text
sudo ziti-edge-tunnel add --jwt "$(< ./in-file.jwt)" --identity myIdentityName
```

[Learn more about enrolling](/learn/core-concepts/identities/20-enrolling.md).

### Load Identities Directory

The tunneller will load all enrolled identities in the `--identity-dir` directory at startup. The default location for
identities is is `/opt/openziti/etc/identities`. Add enrolled identity files to this directory by copying the JSON file
into the directory and setting permissions for group `ziti`.

:::note
Linux package users may place enrollment tokens named `*.jwt` in this directory for automatic enrollment at next
startup.
:::

Ensure the identities directory is writable by group `ziti` and not readable by others to protect the confidentiality of
the identities.

```text
sudo chown -cR :ziti        /opt/openziti/etc/identities
sudo chmod -cR ug=rwX,o-rwx /opt/openziti/etc/identities
```

The tunneller process needs to be restarted if the contents of `/opt/openziti/etc/identities` change.

```text
# package users can restart with systemd
sudo systemctl restart ziti-edge-tunnel.service
```

## Run with Docker

Reference [the article about running the Linux tunneller in a container](/reference/tunnelers/70-docker/readme.mdx) for guidance and
examples.
