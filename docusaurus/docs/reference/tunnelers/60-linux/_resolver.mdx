`ziti-edge-tunnel run` provides a built-in nameserver for the services it is authorized to dial. The nameserver is automatically configured by `systemd-resolved`, if enabled.

If `systemd-resolved` is not enabled, you must configure your resolver to query the tunneler's nameserver. Add Ziti's nameserver to the connection manager, e.g., NetworkManager, Netplan, or by directly editing `/etc/resolv.conf`.

You may configure the system resolver to use the tunneler's nameserver as the first or only nameserver.

When the tunneler nameserver is the first of multiple nameservers and the requested DNS record does not match an authorized service's intercept domain name, it sets the query status to `REFUSE`. This implies that the caller *should* keep trying to resolve the domain name with other nameservers.

To use the tunneler nameserver as the only nameserver, you must specify an upstream nameserver for recursion: `ziti-edge-tunnel run --dns-upstream 208.67.222.222`. In this configuration, the query status from the upstream nameserver is returned, e.g., `NXDOMAIN` if the domain name is not found in the tunneler nameserver or the upstream nameserver.

The IP address of the nameserver (default: `100.64.0.2`) is determined by the tunneler's dns-ip-range (default: `100.64.0.1/10`).
