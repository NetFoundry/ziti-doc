Each tunneller operates similarly. The goal is to have the tunneler seamlessly intercept traffic destined for Ziti
services and forward that traffic over the Ziti overlay instead of the regular (underlay) network. All processes and users on the host enjoy the same access level provided by the tunneler's loaded identities.

A tunneler configures a Ziti nameserver for resolving Ziti service addresses and associated Ziti IP routes in a device's OS. These are quickly updated when a policy change alters the visible Ziti services for any loaded Ziti identity.
