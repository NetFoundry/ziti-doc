## An Example of an OpenZiti Overlay Network
![OpenZiti Overlay Network](../../../static/img/ziti-overview.svg)

## In OpenZiti, You Will Find:

- A zero trust [overlay mesh network](/reference/glossary.md#network-overlay-overlay) composed of a controller, edge routers, and fabric routers.
- Numerous SDKs making it easy to embed zero trust principles directly into your application.
- [Tunneling applications](../../reference/tunnelers/) providing zero trust access to those applications you cannot embed zero trust into directly.
- Zero trust principles such as [authorize before connect](/docs/learn/core-concepts/security/authentication/auth),
  [continual authorization](/docs/learn/core-concepts/security/authorization/auth),
  [least-privilege access](/docs/learn/core-concepts/security/authorization/policies/overview).

OpenZiti makes it **easy** to embed zero trust, programmable networking directly into your app. With OpenZiti, you can have **zero trust, high-performance networking on any Internet connection**, without VPNs!
