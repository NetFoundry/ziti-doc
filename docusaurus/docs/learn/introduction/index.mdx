<h3>In OpenZiti You Will Find</h3>

* A zero trust [overlay mesh network](/reference/glossary.md#network-overlay-overlay) composed of a controller, edge routers and fabric routers
* [Numerous SDKs](/docs/reference/developer/sdk/) making it easy to embed zero trust principles directly into your application
* [Tunneling applications](../../reference/tunnelers/) providing zero trust access to those applications you cannot embed zero trust into directly
* Zero trust principles such as [authorize before connect](/docs/learn/core-concepts/security/authentication/auth),
[continual authorization](/docs/learn/core-concepts/security/authorization/auth),
[least-privilege access](/docs/learn/core-concepts/security/authorization/policies/overview)

OpenZiti makes it **easy** to embed zero trust, programmable networking directly into your app. With OpenZiti you can have **zero trust, high performance networking on any Internet connection**, without VPNs!
