:running: If you are looking to jump right in, feet first, you can follow along with one of our 
[Quickstart Guides](../quickstarts/network/index.md). 

:office: If you are looking for a managed service to help you run a truly global, scalable network browse over to [NetFoundry, Inc](http://netfoundry.io).

The Ziti Network (Ziti) is composed of the following building
blocks: Ziti Controller, Ziti Router, Ziti Clients. These
components are used in conjunction to provide secure
connectivity between two points such as a client to a server. This
type of network is considered an overlay network because it
provides secure connectivity on top – or “overlaying” – existing
networking infrastructure.

Here's an overview of a network topology:
