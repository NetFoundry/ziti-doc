### Ziti

In this series of articles, we are exploring bootstrapping trust, what
that means, and how it enables Zero Trust security methodologies. Ziti
provides a method to bootstrap trust via its enrollment process. For
Ziti, the enrollment process is bootstrapping trust. This trust must be
in place as all connections in Ziti require verification. All identities
in Ziti have a key pair that identifies that individual. The enrollment
process abstracts the steps of setting up keys, certificates, CSRs, CAs,
and deploying them to the proper locations. In addition, the Ziti SDKs
can be embedded within any application and enroll with a Ziti network in
the exact same fashion to bootstrap trust as part of Ziti's Zero Trust
model.


Ziti has a concept called the "Edge." The Edge is a set of software
features that sit on top of the "Fabric." The Fabric is the core of each
Ziti component, and it provides long haul mesh routing while the Edge
focuses on enrolling Ziti components, managing access via policies, and
maintaining the trust necessary to provide the foundation of a Zero
Trust network without the hassle of setting it up yourself. Together
they are a powerful combo of optimized long halt routing and trust
management.

A small scale example Ziti system appears as follows:

Ziti Edge has the concepts of identities for endpoint SDKs and routers.
Both require certificates signed by a trusted CA. Ziti can generate the
PKI necessary to manage that trust. The PKI and its CAs will form the
backbone of the trust system that Ziti will deploy for you. In the
system diagram above, the Ziti Controller will manage an intermediate CA
and a secure enrollment process that will bootstrap trust for each
router and SDK. After bootstrapping trust, the controller will maintain
data to manage the entire life cycle of the certificates it generates.
This life cycle encompasses all the concerns from part one of this
series, including bootstrapping, revoking, renewing, and rotating keys.

So let us review the components a Ziti Controller must have to function:

1. A CA (intermediate preferred)
2. A server certificate generated for the Controller's IP/hostname/etc.
   Signed by the CA or a public CA
3. A Ziti Controller configured and ready to run

This article series has touched on items one and two, but not three. For
information on how to configure a Ziti Controller refer to the Ziti
documentation repository on Github. You will also find details on how to
use the Ziti CLI to generate the PKI necessary to start a Ziti network.
However, here is a simple command that will help get the controller
started.

```
 ziti pki create ca test1
 ziti pki create server --dns myserver.com
```

## Enrollment

Once a Ziti Controller is up and running, it is possible to create a new
identity and enroll it. Behind the scenes, many things happen, but for
now, let us focus on what an administrator would have to perform.

1. Authenticate via the Ziti CLI, Ziti Admin Console (ZAC), or Edge REST
   API
2. Issue a request to create a new identity for an SDK or router
3. Receive an enrollment JWT Use the JWT on the enrolling device/server
   to enroll

In those steps, we have performed many complex interactions.

- The enrolling identity:
  - validated the enrollment JWT cryptographically
  - validated the Ziti Controller as a suitable trust anchor
    cryptographically
  - bootstrapped its trust pool of CAs as additional trust anchors over
    a secure connection
  - generated a key pair
  - generated a CSR
- The controller has:
  - asserted its identity cryptographically
  - asserted the validity of the enrolling identity
  - provided a CA store of trust anchors
  - fulfilled the CSR request for the identity

All of these items are performed making no assumptions and securely
verifying each step. This process does not suffer from man-in-the-middle
attacks. It provides many benefits! Below is a detailed image of each
step of the enrollment process.

Let's break those steps down:

1. Via the Ziti CLI, ZAC, or Edge REST API the admin authenticates and
   requests to create an identity
2. The admin receives a JWT that is signed by the controller and is
   cryptographically verifiable. The JWT contains all the information
   for the enrolling device/server to contact the controller and verify
   its identity. It also includes a secret enrollment token.
3. The JWT is given to the enrolling device
4. The device parses the JWT, verifies all the information is present to
   enroll
5. The device retrieves the public certificate from the controller at
   the address specified in the JWT
6. The device confirms that the server is, in fact, the owner of the
   private key for that certificate
7. The device uses the retrieved certificate to verify the signature on
   the JWT
8. Verifies content has not changed
9. Verifies the issuing server is the server it is communicating with
10. Makes a secure connection to the server and requests the CAs to
    trust
11. The enrolling identity generates a key pair, if necessary, and a
    CSR. The CSR is submitted in a request with the JWT's enrollment
    token.
12. The controller verifies the CSR, verifies the enrollment token,
    verifies the client connection, and then returns the necessary
    signed certificates.

At the end of the process, which took four simple human steps, but
numerous cryptographically secure software steps, the controller now has
a record of the certificates issued to a specific identity. That
identity now has certificates that can be used to make connections to
other enrolled Ziti components. All components in the system can verify
the identity of any other Ziti component. At every step, every link is
verified. No individual piece of software blindly trusts any other for
inbound or outbound connections. Trust has been successfully
bootstrapped! Now we enter a maintenance window where trust has to be
verified continuously and maintained. The enrolled identity can now
interact with the Ziti Controller to either function as a Ziti Router or
as Zero Trust network client.

# Conclusion

Thank you for reading this far! If you completed the entire series, I
hope it has been helpful. Zero Trust is a complicated topic, and it
requires a serious foundation in bootstrapping trust to get right.
Hopefully, this series starts you on your way. If you have time, please

network overlay solution that I have personally worked on and was the
inspiration for this series.
