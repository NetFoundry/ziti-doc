Tunneler enables non-Ziti apps to tether to your Ziti network and is an alternative to the SDK. The endpoint SDK enables your apps to join a Ziti network directly, and Tunneler enables your apps to send and receive with the network indirectly via Tunneler much like a WiFi hotspot allows your laptop to tether to your mobile device's data uplink. Tunneler directs traffic matching a Ziti service by domain name or IP address over the Ziti overlay instead of the underlay network.
