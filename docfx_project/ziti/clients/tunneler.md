# Tunnelers

[!include[](~/ziti/clients/tunneler-overview.md)]

Tunneler functions similarly for desktop and mobile operating systems. The default mode of operation for Tunneler is to configure the operating system's DNS resolver to check with Tunneler for matches before recursing internet nameservers. Alternatively, the command-line interface (CLI) versions of Tunneler offer a `proxy` mode that binds a particular service to a particular local port instead of matching the IP destination or domain name.
