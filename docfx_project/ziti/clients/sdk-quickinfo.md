## Zitify your application

Import the endpoint SDK in your project! This empowers your app to join your Ziti network directly as an endpoint and is an alternative to using [Tunneler](../../ziti/clients/tunneler.md).

Connecting your custom app directly to your network has significant advantages.

* create a truly zero-trust distributed system from the start
* host an invisible server in your custom app that's instantly accessible to authorized Ziti endpoints
* deploy clients and servers anywhere without any dependence upon network infrastructure and configuration beyond a commodity internet circuit

Navigate over to [the API documentation](../../api/index.md) or [the Open Ziti project home page](https://ziti.dev) to learn more about the endpoint SDK for your preferred stack.
